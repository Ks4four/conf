## Plugins

### Contanki

[Contanki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1898790263) is a plugin that adds controller support to Anki.

#### Installation

To install Contanki, use the AnkiWeb shared ID `1898790263`.

#### My profile

My profile is configured for joystick-only use.

- Any direction on the joystick can **flip cards**.
- The four directional inputs are used to mark cards as **Easy**, **Good**, **Bad**, or **Again**.

Additionally, the `LT` and `RT` buttons are used for flipping cards,
while the `LB` and `RB` buttons are used for undoing actions if needed.

#### Import and Export

The plugin supports importing and exporting configuration files in the `.contanki` format.
